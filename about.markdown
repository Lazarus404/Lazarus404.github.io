        <h1>About Me</h1>
      </header>

      <p>I've been working as a software engineer since 1999, having left University studying for a BA Hons Visual Studies degree.  Odd combination, really.  I'm back at that same Uni right now, but this time I'm studying for a BEng Hons Electronic Systems Engineering degree.</p>

      <p>During my career, I've built intranet systems for the likes of Lloyds Bank, Crest Nicholson and Murphy's Construction.  I've written numerous games for the BBC, Cartoon Network, Nickelodean and Tiger Aspect, of which two of those endeavours won BAFTA's!  I've created cashless payment kiosks linked to vending networks in a high-rise law company in Central London, built a scalable e-commerce platform deployed in China and used by some of China's top companies, created streaming media platforms proxying millions of connections and even designed a browser based replacement for the Flash platform, written entirely in JavaScript!  It's been a fun ride!</p>

      <p>These days, I work at Aircall.  I handle the Call Quality strategies for the Internet voice connections, creating useful tools to improve Aircalls infrastructure and write tons of documentation (which I absolutely love to do).</p>

      <p>Outside of work, I have a gorgeous supportive wife of over 22 years and two fantastic children... Well, adults, really.  I also have two kittens of the British Blue variety.  Life is good!</p>

      <p>This website exists to house my more recent works, musings and projects.  Have a look around and come back often.</p>
