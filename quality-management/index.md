So, this term, I'm learning Quality Management.  In an Electronics degree.  Not something I'm enjoying thus far.  As a person with an R&D nature, I find sweating the small tuff to be against my nature.  I prefer the "meat of the bone".  I exist to figure out the big things.  Forget A-to-B; how do I get from A-to-Z?

When subjects don't grab hold of my interest, I find it difficult to maintain focus.  Thus, this section of the website is even more important.  Let's just get this term over an done with, so I can start with the pleasurable torture of Digital Signal Processing next term.
