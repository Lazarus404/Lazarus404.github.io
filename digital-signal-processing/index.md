Signals can be represented using two views or domains;

* Time domain refers to samples taken over time, represented in lower-case letters, eg. `x(t)`.
* Frequency domain describes the amplitude of the waves in a signal, represented in upper-case letters, eg. `X[t]`.

The frequency domain contains exactly the same information as the time domain, just in a different format. If you know one domain, then you can calculate the other.

### Proper Sampling

Proper sampling is defined as the ability to reconstruct an exact analog signal from samples. Thus, a digital signal that cannot be fully realised back into its original analog format is not properly sampled.
