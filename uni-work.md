This year, I've decided to start documenting the subjects I'm learning at University.  Not only is this a good way to get my thoughts straight, but I've noticed the lecturers tend to assume knowledge.  As such, I thought breaking down everything and including everything would be a good resource for others.

Additionally, I will be including calculators that provide "workings out" for those that find them useful.  This is mainly because I find that putting formulas into code helps me to understand them better.  I am a grizzled coder, after all.
