  <h2 id="content">The World's Simplest TURN Server</h2>
  <p>Understanding WebRTC can be a challenge, even for seasoned web developers. The main reason for this is the complexity of the transport mechanism and the integration of STUN and TURN. The XTurn project is a TURN server written in Elixir. It was developed not to be a fast, all-singing, all-dancing TURN server, but to be easy to understand. The idea is; if a developer can understand what XTurn is doing, then the mystery of STUN and TURN will disappear.</p>

  		<h3>Built With Elixir</h3>
  		<p>Elixir, which itself is built on Erlang, is a language and platform designed specifically for creating servers such as this. Erlang was built in the late 1980's for use in the Telecom's industry. It is a tried and tested platform able to handle media throughput at high speed with incredible reliability. What's more, it's in-built binary pattern matching capabilities make it super easy to write binary parsers which, in turn, are easy to read and understand.</p>

  		<h3>Full WebRTC Specification Capabilities</h3>
  		<p>XTurn provides full support for each of the RFC specifications supported by WebRTC. This includes channel-binding. However, some features are written in a simple and lightweight manner, so that they can be extended to suit the needs of the adopter, such as the authentication mechanism.</p>
